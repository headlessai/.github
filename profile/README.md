## Hi there 👋

🚀 HeadlessAI is a set of npm tools that developers can use to train their own GPT model using custom documentation data. It's currently in development, but we're excited to share the progress with you.

🔥 This library is designed to work seamlessly with Supabase, a powerful and scalable cloud database service, making it easier than ever to create human-like responses tailored to your specific use case.

📝 One of the unique features of HeadlessAI is its ability to train the GPT model using the `.mdx` files in the Next.js `pages` folder. That means you can use your existing documentation as the training data for your GPT model.

So, are you ready to dive into the exciting world of HeadlessAI? Let's get started! 🤗
